## Running Bargaining Benchmarks

### Load and Execute Task

```python
import json
from marble import BargainingEnvironment, MultiAgentSystem

# Load bargaining task
with open('multiagentbench/bargaining/bargaining_main.jsonl') as f:
    tasks = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

task = tasks[0]

# Initialize bargaining environment
bargain_env = BargainingEnvironment(
    max_iterations=task['environment']['max_iterations']
)

# Create multi-agent system
mas = MultiAgentSystem(
    agents=task['agents'],
    environment=bargain_env,
    relationships=task['relationships']
)

# Run negotiation
result = mas.run(task['task']['content'])

print(f"Deal Reached: {result.agreement}")
if result.agreement:
    print(f"Final Price: ${result.terms['price']:.2f}")
    print(f"Iterations: {result.iterations}")
```

### Evaluate Negotiation

```python
from marble.benchmarks.bargaining import BargainingEvaluator

evaluator = BargainingEvaluator()

scores = evaluator.evaluate(
    negotiation_history=result.messages,
    final_terms=result.terms,
    product_info=task['task']['product'],
    buyer_priorities=task['task']['buyer_priorities'],
    seller_priorities=task['task']['seller_priorities']
)

print(f"Deal Quality: {scores.deal_quality:.2f}")
print(f"Process Quality: {scores.process:.2f}")
print(f"Buyer Satisfaction: {scores.buyer_satisfaction:.2f}")
print(f"Seller Satisfaction: {scores.seller_satisfaction:.2f}")
print(f"Overall Score: {scores.overall:.2f}")
```

### Batch Evaluation

```python
from marble.benchmarks import BenchmarkRunner

runner = BenchmarkRunner(
    benchmark='bargaining',
    model='gpt-4o',
    num_tasks=100,
    output_dir='results/bargaining'
)

results = runner.run_all()

print(f"Agreement Rate: {results.agreement_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Avg Final Price: ${results.avg_price:.2f}")
print(f"Avg Iterations: {results.avg_iterations:.1f}")
print(f"Avg Satisfaction: {results.avg_satisfaction:.2f}")
```

## Example Negotiation

### Task: Rolling Cart Negotiation

**Product**: 3-Tier Utility Cart ($46.99, 4.7★)  
**Buyer Priority**: Timely delivery  
**Seller Priority**: Premium pricing justification

**Negotiation Flow**:

```python
# Round 1: Buyer opens
buyer.offer_price(
    40.00,
    "Similar 3-tier carts available at $35-45 range"
)

# Round 2: Seller responds
seller.reject_and_counter(
    46.99,
    "Premium steel construction and 4.7-star rating justify price",
    concessions=["Free standard shipping"]
)

# Round 3: Buyer emphasizes priority
buyer.provide_information(
    "delivery_requirement",
    {"needed_by": "5 days", "reason": "home organization project"}
)

# Round 4: Seller offers solution
seller.reject_and_counter(
    44.99,
    "$2 discount for volume, includes expedited shipping (3 days)",
    concessions=[
        "Expedited shipping (normally $8.99)",
        "Assembly video tutorial"
    ]
)

# Round 5: Buyer accepts
buyer.end_negotiation(
    "agree",
    {
        "price": 44.99,
        "shipping": "expedited (3 days)",
        "extras": ["assembly tutorial"],
        "warranty": "standard"
    }
)
```

**Outcome Analysis**:
- **Price**: $44.99 (buyer saved $2, seller maintains margin)
- **Delivery**: Expedited shipping meets buyer's timeline
- **Seller**: Added value without deep discount
- **Iterations**: 5 (efficient)
- **Satisfaction**: High for both parties

## Negotiation Strategies

### For Buyers

1. **Anchoring**: Start with reasonable but low offer
2. **Market Research**: Reference comparable products
3. **Priority Focus**: Emphasize key requirements
4. **Bundle Thinking**: Request package deals
5. **Walk-Away Willingness**: Have alternatives ready

### For Sellers

1. **Value Demonstration**: Highlight quality and features
2. **Concession Trading**: Offer non-price benefits
3. **Volume Opportunities**: Suggest bulk or future purchases
4. **Premium Justification**: Explain price differentiation
5. **Relationship Building**: Focus on long-term partnership

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Price Gap
**Problem**: Large difference between buyer/seller expectations  
**Solution**: Find creative middle ground with concessions

### Challenge 2: Priority Mismatch
**Problem**: Buyer wants speed, seller wants commitment  
**Solution**: Package deal with expedited delivery + future order

### Challenge 3: Information Asymmetry
**Problem**: One party has more market knowledge  
**Solution**: Share relevant information transparently

### Challenge 4: Impasse
**Problem**: Neither party willing to move  
**Solution**: Introduce third-party mediation or walk away

## Best Practices

### For Effective Negotiation
1. **Start with research** on market prices and alternatives
2. **Listen actively** to understand other party's priorities
3. **Use tools appropriately** with clear reasoning
4. **Be flexible** on non-critical points
5. **Document agreements** clearly

### For Agent Design
1. **Model realistic behaviors** (not always adversarial)
2. **Include personality** traits (aggressive, cooperative, etc.)
3. **Implement learning** from previous negotiations
4. **Balance interests** appropriately
5. **Know when to walk away**

## Task Difficulty Levels

| Level | Tasks | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Simple** | 1-30 | Small price gap, aligned priorities, clear market value |
| **Moderate** | 31-70 | Moderate price gap, some priority conflicts, multiple terms |
| **Complex** | 71-100 | Large price gap, competing priorities, multi-dimensional negotiation |
