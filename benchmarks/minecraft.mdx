## Task Structure

### Blueprint Format

Each task includes a blueprint with:

```json
{
  "task": {
    "content": "Build a building according to a blueprint. The blueprint contains:
    - Material specifications
    - Facing directions for directional blocks
    - Absolute coordinates (x, y, z)
    - Additional placement requirements"
  }
}
```

### Available Actions

#### Material Management
```python
# Retrieve items from container
withdrawItem(item_name: str, quantity: int)

# Examples
withdrawItem("stone", 64)
withdrawItem("oak_planks", 32)
```

#### Block Placement
```python
# Place a single block
placeBlock(
    position: Tuple[int, int, int],
    block_type: str,
    facing: str = None  # For directional blocks
)

# Examples
placeBlock((100, 64, 200), "stone")
placeBlock((100, 65, 200), "stairs", facing="north")
```

#### Auxiliary Structures
```python
# Create dirt ladder for access
erectDirtLadder(
    start: Tuple[int, int, int],
    height: int
)

# Remove dirt ladder
dismantleDirtLadder(
    start: Tuple[int, int, int],
    height: int
)

# Mine/remove blocks
mineBlock(position: Tuple[int, int, int])

# Examples
erectDirtLadder((100, 64, 200), height=10)
dismantleDirtLadder((100, 64, 200), height=10)
```

## Construction Challenges

### Challenge 1: Floating Blocks
**Problem**: Blocks cannot be placed in midair without support  
**Solution**: Use temporary scaffolding, then remove after construction

```python
# Build floating platform
# 1. Create temporary support
agent3.erectDirtLadder((100, 64, 200), height=10)
agent3.placeBlock((100, 74, 200), "dirt")  # Temp platform

# 2. Place target blocks from support
agent1.placeBlock((100, 75, 200), "stone")

# 3. Remove temporary structures
agent3.mineBlock((100, 74, 200))
agent3.dismantleDirtLadder((100, 64, 200), height=10)
```

### Challenge 2: Directional Blocks
**Problem**: Stairs, doors, and other blocks have facing direction  
**Solution**: Specify correct facing direction in placeBlock

```python
# Place stairs facing north
agent1.placeBlock((100, 64, 200), "oak_stairs", facing="north")

# Place door (bottom half)
agent1.placeBlock((100, 64, 201), "oak_door", facing="east")
```

### Challenge 3: Build Order Dependencies
**Problem**: Some blocks must be placed before others  
**Solution**: Agent 2 analyzes and plans correct sequence

```python
# Correct order for elevated structure:
# 1. Ground level
# 2. Support columns
# 3. Upper level
# 4. Remove temporary supports
```

### Challenge 4: Resource Management
**Problem**: Need exact materials and quantities  
**Solution**: Agent 1 calculates and retrieves all needed materials upfront

```python
# Calculate needs
total_blocks = structure.count_blocks_by_type()

# Retrieve all at once
for block_type, quantity in total_blocks.items():
    agent1.withdrawItem(block_type, quantity)
```

## Running Minecraft Benchmarks

### Setup Minecraft Server

```bash
# Start Minecraft server
cd minecraft_server
java -Xmx2G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui

# Wait for "Done!" message
# Server runs on localhost:25565
```

### Load and Execute Task

```python
import json
from marble import MinecraftEnvironment, MultiAgentSystem

# Load Minecraft task
with open('multiagentbench/minecraft/minecraft_main.jsonl') as f:
    tasks = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

task = tasks[0]

# Initialize Minecraft environment
mc_env = MinecraftEnvironment(
    host=task['environment']['host'],
    port=task['environment']['port'],
    max_iterations=task['environment']['max_iterations']
)

# Create multi-agent system

### Evaluate Construction

```python
from marble.benchmarks.minecraft import MinecraftEvaluator

evaluator = MinecraftEvaluator(mc_env)

scores = evaluator.evaluate(
    blueprint=task['task']['content'],
    built_structure=result.structure,
    actions=result.actions
)

print(f"Structure Accuracy: {scores.accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Process Efficiency: {scores.efficiency:.2f}")
print(f"Collaboration Quality: {scores.collaboration:.2f}")
print(f"Cleanup Score: {scores.cleanup:.2f}")
print(f"Overall: {scores.overall:.2f}")
```

### Batch Evaluation

```python

## Visualization

### View Construction Progress

```python
from marble.benchmarks.minecraft import MinecraftVisualizer

visualizer = MinecraftVisualizer()

# Create time-lapse visualization
visualizer.create_timelapse(
    actions=result.actions,
    output_file='construction_timelapse.mp4',
    fps=2
)

# Create 3D structure comparison
visualizer.compare_structures(
    blueprint=task['task']['content'],
    built=result.structure,
    output_file='structure_comparison.html'
)
```

## Best Practices

### For Construction Planning
1. **Analyze blueprint** completely before starting
2. **Identify dependencies** early (what must be built first)
3. **Plan scaffolding** for elevated sections
4. **Calculate materials** needed upfront
5. **Consider gravity** (blocks fall if unsupported)

### For Collaboration
1. **Communicate plans** clearly before execution
2. **Assign clear roles** based on agent capabilities
3. **Coordinate timing** to avoid conflicts
4. **Monitor progress** and adjust plans if needed
5. **Clean up together** after main construction

### For Efficiency
1. **Batch material retrieval** instead of multiple trips
2. **Build from bottom up** generally
3. **Use minimal scaffolding** needed
4. **Work in parallel** when possible
5. **Remove scaffolding** incrementally during build

## Task Difficulty Levels
