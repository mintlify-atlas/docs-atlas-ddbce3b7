## Research Ideation Process

### Phase 1: Context Sharing
Agents share their expertise areas and recent research directions

```python
agent1: "I've been working on privacy-preserving techniques in 
federated learning, particularly differential privacy methods."

for high-quality data synthesis."
```

### Phase 2: Intersection Identification
Agents identify overlapping interests and complementary strengths

```python
agent1: "Your diffusion model expertise could address the synthetic 
data generation challenge in federated learning."

agent2: "And your differential privacy work could enhance the privacy 
guarantees of generative models."
```

```python
research_idea = {
    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Diffusion Models for Federated Learning",
    "approach": "Combine differential privacy with diffusion models",
    "novelty": "First work to integrate DP with diffusion-based FL",
    "applications": ["Healthcare", "Finance", "Edge computing"]
}
```

# Privacy-Preserving Federated Diffusion Models

## Abstract
We propose a novel framework combining differential privacy (DP) with 
diffusion models for federated learning (FL), enabling high-quality 
synthetic data generation while preserving privacy.

## Key Innovation
- First integration of DP mechanisms with diffusion-based FL
- Novel noise injection strategy preserving diffusion properties
- Theoretical privacy guarantees with empirical utility validation

## Technical Approach
1. Client-side diffusion model training with DP-SGD
2. Private aggregation using secure multi-party computation
3. Adaptive noise scheduling for privacy-utility trade-off

## Applications
- Healthcare: Synthetic patient data for model training
- Finance: Privacy-preserving synthetic transactions
- IoT: Edge device data augmentation

## Evaluation Plan
- Privacy: Theoretical DP guarantees, empirical privacy auditing
- Utility: FID scores, downstream task performance
- Efficiency: Communication costs, computation time

## Expected Challenges
- Balancing privacy budget across diffusion steps
- Convergence in heterogeneous federated settings
- Computational overhead at edge devices

## Timeline: 18 months
- Months 1-6: Algorithm design and theoretical analysis
- Months 7-12: Implementation and benchmark evaluation
- Months 13-18: Application studies and paper writing
```

### For Evaluation
1. **Define clear metrics** upfront
2. **Consider multiple perspectives** (novelty, feasibility, impact)
3. **Assess risks** realistically
4. **Plan evaluation** methodology
5. **Estimate resources** accurately
