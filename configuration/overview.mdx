description: Understanding MARBLE's YAML-based configuration system
---

MARBLE uses YAML configuration files to define multi-agent systems. Each configuration file specifies agents, environments, coordination modes, memory systems, and evaluation metrics.

## Configuration Structure

A MARBLE configuration file consists of these key sections:

<ParamField path="coordinate_mode" type="string" required>
  Defines how agents interact with each other. Options:
  - `graph`: Agents collaborate in a network with bidirectional relationships
  - `star`: Centralized coordination with a hub agent
  - `chain`: Sequential processing where agents work one after another
  - `tree`: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="relationships" type="array" required>
  Defines connections between agents as `[agent1, agent2, "relationship_type"]`. Common types:
  - `collaborates with`: Peer-to-peer collaboration
  - `reports_to`: Hierarchical reporting
  - `parent`: Tree structure parent-child
  - `manages`, `supports`: Custom relationships
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="environment" type="object" required>
  Configuration for the execution environment where agents operate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="task" type="object" required>
  The task description and requirements that agents will work on.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agents" type="array" required>
  List of agent configurations defining their types, IDs, and profiles.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="memory" type="object">
  Memory system configuration for agent information sharing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="metrics" type="object">
  Evaluation metrics to assess agent performance and collaboration.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="llm" type="string">
  Default language model for all agents (e.g., `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`, `"gpt-4o-mini"`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="engine_planner" type="object">
  Engine and planner configuration for orchestrating agent execution.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="output" type="object">
  Output configuration for saving results.
</ParamField>

## Configuration Files Location

Configuration files are located in `marble/configs/`:

```
marble/configs/
├── config.py              # Config class implementation
├── prompt_config.yaml     # Reasoning strategy prompts
├── coding_configs/        # Software development configurations
├── test_config/          # Test and simulation configs
└── test_config_*.yaml    # Various test scenarios
```

## Basic Example

Here's a minimal configuration for a collaborative web research task:

```yaml
coordinate_mode: chain

relationships:
  - [agent1, agent2, "reports_to"]
  - [agent1, agent3, "manages"]

environment:
  type: Web
  name: "Web Simulation Environment"
  max_iterations: 5

task:
  content: "Find news about the latest trends in AI and have agent1 summarize it."

agents:
  - type: BaseAgent
    agent_id: agent1
    profile: "You are a helpful team leader who summarizes information."

  - type: BaseAgent
    agent_id: agent2
    profile: "You are a researcher who uses Bing to find information."

  - type: BaseAgent
    agent_id: agent3
    profile: "You are a researcher who uses Google to find information."

memory:
  type: SharedMemory

engine_planner:
  initial_progress: "Starting the simulation."
```

## Loading Configuration

Configurations are loaded using the `Config` class:

```python
from marble.configs.config import Config

# Load configuration from YAML file
config = Config.load("marble/configs/test_config.yaml")

# Access configuration properties
print(config.coordination_mode)  # 'chain'
print(config.agents)             # List of agent configs
print(config.environment)        # Environment config dict
```

<Warning>
  **Configuration Validation**: MARBLE validates configurations at load time. Ensure all referenced agents exist in relationships, and coordination modes match the relationship structure (e.g., tree mode requires parent relationships).
