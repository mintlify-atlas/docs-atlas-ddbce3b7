## Introduction

MARBLE provides a diverse set of environments that enable multi-agent systems to collaborate on complex tasks. Each environment is designed for specific domains and comes with specialized tools and APIs.

## Environment Architecture

All environments inherit from the `BaseEnvironment` class, which provides:

- **Action Registration**: Register custom actions that agents can perform
- **State Management**: Track environment state across agent interactions
- **Iteration Control**: Manage task completion and limits
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration through YAML files

### Base Environment Structure

```python
from marble.environments.base_env import BaseEnvironment

class CustomEnvironment(BaseEnvironment):
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any], name: str = "CustomEnv"):
        super().__init__(name, config)
        
        # Register custom actions
        self.register_action(
            action_name="custom_action",
            handler=self._custom_action_handler,
            description={
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "custom_action",
                    "description": "Description of the action",
                    "parameters": {...}
                }
            }
        )
```

## Configuration Format

All environments use YAML configuration files with the following structure:

```yaml
coordinate_mode: chain  # or graph

environment:
  type: Research  # Environment type
  name: "Research Collaboration Environment"
  max_iterations: 5
  # Environment-specific settings

task:
  content: "Your task description here"

agents:
  - type: BaseAgent
    agent_id: agent1
    profile: "Agent profile and capabilities"

memory:
  type: SharedMemory

metrics:
  evaluate_llm: gpt-4o
```

## Common Features

### Action System

All environments support action registration using OpenAI function calling format:

```python
action_description = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "action_name",
        "description": "What this action does",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "param1": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Parameter description"
                }
            },
            "required": ["param1"],
            "additionalProperties": False
        }
    }
}
```

### State Management

Environments maintain state that can be accessed by agents:

```python
# Get current environment state
state = env.get_state()

# Apply an action
result = env.apply_action(
    agent_id="agent1",
    action_name="custom_action",
    arguments={"param1": "value"}
)
```
