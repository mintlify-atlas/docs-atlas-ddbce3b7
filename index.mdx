## What is MARBLE?

**MARBLE** (Multi-Agent Coordination Backbone with LLM Engine) is a modular and extensible framework designed to facilitate the development, testing, and evaluation of multi-agent systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured environment where agents can interact within various simulated environments, utilizing cognitive abilities and communication mechanisms to perform tasks collaboratively or competitively.

## Architecture Overview

MARBLE is built around several core components that work together to create powerful multi-agent systems:

### Core Components

- **Agents**: Autonomous entities with profiles, strategies, and reasoning capabilities that can perform actions within environments
- **Environments**: Simulated spaces where agents operate (Web, Coding, Research, Minecraft, Database, etc.)
- **Engine**: Orchestrates agent interactions and manages execution flow
- **Memory Systems**: Short-term and shared memory for agent communication and state management
- **LLM Integration**: Unified interface for prompting various language models
- **Agent Graph**: Defines relationships and coordination modes between agents

## Use Cases

MARBLE excels at modeling complex multi-agent scenarios:

- **Collaborative Software Development**: Multiple agents working together to design, implement, and optimize code
- **Research Automation**: Agents collecting papers, analyzing content, and synthesizing findings
- **Web Task Automation**: Coordinated web browsing and information gathering
- **Database Diagnostics**: Multi-agent systems for detecting and resolving database anomalies
- **Game Playing**: Agents competing or cooperating in game environments
