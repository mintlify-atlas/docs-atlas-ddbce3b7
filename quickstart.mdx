## Overview

This quickstart guide will walk you through running your first multi-agent simulation with MARBLE. You'll set up a simple web research task where multiple agents collaborate to gather and summarize information about AI trends.

<Note>
  Make sure you've completed the [installation](/installation) steps before proceeding.
</Note>

## Run Your First Simulation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a configuration file">
    MARBLE uses YAML configuration files to define agents, environments, and tasks. Create a new file called `my_first_config.yaml`:

    ```yaml my_first_config.yaml
    coordinate_mode: chain
    
    relationships:
      - [researcher, analyst, "reports_to"]
    
    llm: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    
    environment:
      type: Web
      name: "Web Research Environment"
      max_iterations: 5
    
    task:
      content: "Research the latest trends in AI and have the analyst summarize the findings."
    
    agents:
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: researcher
        profile: "You are a thorough researcher. Use web search to find reliable information about AI trends."
      
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: analyst
        profile: "You are an analytical thinker. Synthesize research findings into clear, concise summaries."
    
    memory:
      type: SharedMemory
    
    engine_planner:
      initial_progress: "Starting AI trends research simulation."
    ```

    <Tip>
      The `coordinate_mode` can be either `chain` (sequential execution) or `graph` (parallel/hierarchical execution based on relationships).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the simulation">
    Execute your multi-agent simulation using the MARBLE engine:

    ```bash
    python marble/main.py --config_path my_first_config.yaml
    ```

    You'll see output showing the agents interacting, making decisions, and completing the task:

    ```text
    INFO - Starting engine with configuration: my_first_config.yaml
    INFO - Agent 'researcher' initialized.
    INFO - Agent 'analyst' initialized.
    INFO - Starting AI trends research simulation.
    INFO - Agent 'researcher' performing action: web_search
    INFO - Agent 'analyst' performing action: synthesize_results
    ...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the results">
    After the simulation completes, MARBLE will output the results. Check the console for the final summary and any generated output files.

    <Note>
      Results are typically saved in the output directory specified in your configuration or displayed in the console logs.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Collaborative Code Development

Let's try a more advanced example with multiple agents collaborating on a coding task. This example uses the pre-configured coding environment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the scripts directory">
    ```bash
    cd marble
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the coding demo">
    Use the provided demo script to see agents collaborating on software development:

    ```bash
    bash run_demo.sh
    ```

    This script runs a simulation where three agents work together:
    - **Agent 1**: Creates the initial code framework
    - **Agent 2**: Adds missing functionality
    - **Agent 3**: Optimizes and refines the code
  </Step>

  <Step title="Examine the configuration">
    The coding demo uses the configuration at `marble/configs/coding_config/coding_config.yaml`. Let's look at key sections:

    ```yaml
    coordinate_mode: graph
    
    relationships:
      - [agent1, agent2, "collaborates with"]
      - [agent2, agent3, "collaborates with"]
      - [agent3, agent1, "collaborates with"]
    
    llm: "gpt-4o-mini"
    
    environment:
      type: Coding
      name: "Coding Environment"
      workspace_dir: "workspace"
      max_iterations: 5
    
    agents:
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: agent1
        profile: |
          I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python.
          I create code frameworks from scratch.
          I must call "create_code" action to create the initial code.
      
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: agent2
        profile: |
          I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python.
          I add missing functionality to existing code.
          I must call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: agent3
        profile: |
          I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python.
          I optimize and fix issues in existing code.
          I must call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
    ```

    <Tip>
      Agent profiles define their expertise and guide their decision-making. Clear profiles lead to better task distribution and collaboration.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the output">
    After the simulation completes, check the workspace directory for the generated code:

    ```bash
    cat workspace/solution.py
    ```

    You'll see the collaboratively developed solution!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coordination Modes">
    - **chain**: Agents execute sequentially in a linear pipeline
    - **graph**: Agents execute based on their relationship graph, enabling parallel and hierarchical coordination
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment Types">
    MARBLE supports multiple environment types:
    - **Web**: For web browsing and online research tasks
    - **Coding**: For software development and code generation
    - **Research**: For academic paper collection and analysis
    - **Database**: For database diagnostics and optimization
    - **Minecraft**: For game-playing scenarios
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent Strategies">
    You can specify reasoning strategies for agents:
    ```yaml
    agents:
      - type: BaseAgent
        agent_id: agent1
        strategy: cot  # Chain of Thought reasoning
    ```
    
    Available strategies:
    - **default**: Standard reasoning
    - **cot**: Chain of Thought (step-by-step reasoning)
    - **reflexion**: Reflective reasoning with self-critique
    - **react**: Reasoning and Acting in synergy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory Configuration">
    Configure how agents share information:
    ```yaml
    memory:
      type: SharedMemory
    ```
    
    - **SharedMemory**: Agents can access and update shared state
    - **BaseMemory**: Individual agent memory without sharing
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Configuration file not found error">
    Make sure you're running the command from the correct directory and that your config file path is correct:
    
    ```bash
    # Use absolute path
    python marble/main.py --config_path /full/path/to/config.yaml
    
    # Or relative path from project root
    python marble/main.py --config_path ./my_first_config.yaml
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API rate limit errors">
    If you hit API rate limits with OpenAI:
    - Use a lower-cost model like `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4`
    - Reduce `max_iterations` in your environment config
    - Consider using Together AI for alternative models
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents not collaborating as expected">
    Check your agent profiles and relationships:
    - Ensure profiles clearly define each agent's role
    - Verify relationships are properly defined in the `relationships` section
    - Try switching between `chain` and `graph` coordination modes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty or incomplete results">
    If simulations produce incomplete results:
    - Increase `max_iterations` in the environment config
    - Make the task description more specific
    - Check logs for any errors during execution
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
